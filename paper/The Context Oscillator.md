## Abstract

Current large language model context windows fail not because
they are too small but because they do not breathe.
Fixed-container context architectures operate as perpetual
held inhales — admitting information continuously until capacity
is reached, then dropping content indiscriminately from the
earliest layers.
This failure mode is not arbitrary.
It mirrors the biological collapse sequence described in the
Unified Regulatory Model: substrate drops first,
and everything above it loses its floor.

This paper proposes the Context Oscillator — a dynamic
context membrane that replicates the respiratory mechanics
of human working memory.
The oscillator inhales toward signal, exhales resolved content
while retaining pointers, and maintains a core hold of
structural invariants that are never released regardless of
exhale depth.
The minimum context state — analogous to residual lung volume —
is a compact decoder (the CODEC) that keeps the system
navigable without carrying full resolution content.

The author's unique position: a network engineer with AuDHD
and FND recovery history who rebuilt respiratory mechanics
from substrate level and simultaneously built a formal
model of that process.
The existence proof for the context oscillator is not
theoretical. It is the author's own cognitive architecture,
formalized across six published papers.

## 0. The Unified Regulatory Model (URM) in Brief

This paper proposes an AI architecture that replicates human working memory.
To understand why the proposal works, you need to understand the URM—
the eight-layer model of finite-resource systems that the proposal is based on.

Here's what you need to know.

### The Eight Layers

The URM describes collapse and recovery across eight layers of function.
Each layer is a substrate that supports the layers above it.

| Layer | Name                   | What It Governs                             |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 01    | Physics Substrate      | Breathing, HRV, RSA, oscillation amplitude  |
| 02    | Prediction Windows     | Cognitive flexibility, branching factor     |
| 03    | Interoceptive Load     | Load accumulation, gating failure           |
| 04    | Semantic Cognition     | Language, referential drift                 |
| 05    | Social Environment     | Masking, compliance, institutional pressure |
| 06    | Transformer Analogs    | Hallucination, attention curvature          |
| 07    | Economics              | Externalized finite-resource dynamics       |
| 08    | Consciousness Gradient | Composite coherence (Cₛ)                    |

### The Critical Invariant

Collapse always propagates upward:

> **Layer 01 drops → everything above it loses its floor.**

This is not a preference. It is a structural constraint.
You cannot restore Layer 08 (consciousness) without first restoring
Layer 01 (physics substrate). The ceiling is set by the floor.

The same sequence applies to AI context windows:
the foundational definitions (Layer 01 equivalent) sit at the bottom
of the context container. When truncation occurs, they drop first.
Everything built on top of them loses its floor.
The system begins gap-filling from training data.
Hallucination increases.

### The CODEC

The CODEC is a compact representation of the URM's structure:
~300-800 tokens that contain the variables, equations, operators,
contracts, and sequencing rule that define the model.

It is the **minimum always-loaded structural core**.
The context oscillator never goes below this floor.
Every inhale begins from this foundation.
Every exhale stops here.

### What This Paper Adds

The URM provides the formal model.
This paper provides the AI architecture that instantiates it:

- **Inhale mechanics**: Admit information toward signal
- **Exhale mechanics**: Release resolved content, retain pointers
- **Core hold**: Structural invariants never release
- **Residual volume**: The CODEC—always present, never empty

The result is a context oscillator that breathes,
replacing the fixed context window that holds its breath and collapses.

---

**For readers new to the URM:** This primer is sufficient to understand
the proposal. The full URM_CORE is available at [DOI].
The key insight is simple: context windows fail because they don't breathe.
The fix is respiratory mechanics applied to information architecture.

---

## 1. The Problem: AI Context is a Held Inhale

### 1.1 What a context window actually does

A language model's context window is a fixed-size container.
Everything the model can reason about must be inside that container.
When the container is full, new content cannot enter without
old content leaving.
Current systems handle this with truncation — the oldest content
drops from the bottom when the ceiling is reached.

This architecture has three critical failure properties:

**Failure 1 — No exhale mechanism.**
Content enters but never leaves voluntarily.
The system cannot release resolved content.
It cannot prune dead branches.
It cannot compress zoomed content back to pointer form.
The only exit is truncation — involuntary, indiscriminate,
from the bottom up.

**Failure 2 — No core hold.**
When truncation occurs, everything is equally vulnerable.
There is no structural invariant that is protected from dropping.
The substrate — the foundational definitions that everything
else references — is as vulnerable as the most recent turn.

**Failure 3 — No residual volume.**
The container can theoretically empty completely.
There is no minimum context floor.
No guaranteed always-available structural core.

The result: the context window behaves like a lung with no
exhale reflex, no core musculature, and no residual volume.
It fills. It holds. It collapses.

### 1.2 Why this matters

The failure mode is not random degradation.
It follows a predictable sequence that mirrors biological
regulatory collapse.

In the Unified Regulatory Model (Robinson 2026), collapse
always follows the same directional sequence:
Layer 01 (physics substrate) drops first.
Everything above it loses its floor.

In a context window under load:
- The foundational definitions (Layer 01 equivalent) were loaded first
- They sit at the bottom of the context container
- When truncation occurs, they drop first
- Everything built on top of them loses its floor
- The model begins gap-filling from training data
- Hallucination increases as schema distance (δ) rises and
  constraint density (D) falls
- H = f(δ/D, T, S) (Robinson 2026)

The AI context window fails in the same sequence as
biological collapse because it is the same finite resource
problem with no recovery operator.

## 2. Why Human Working Memory Doesn't Have This Problem

### 2.1 Working memory oscillates

Human working memory is not a fixed container.
It is a dynamic membrane that continuously oscillates between
expansion and contraction.

The mechanics are respiratory in both the literal and
architectural sense. This is not metaphor — it is confirmed
by oscillatory dynamics research across working memory stages.
Ávila-Garibay et al. (2026) demonstrate load-dependent theta
increases during retrieval and alpha modulation during
maintenance, showing stage-specific oscillatory expansion
and contraction of working memory capacity.
Myers et al. (2026) show that beta oscillations support
priority shifts and clearing operations — directly matching
the exhale mechanics described in this paper.
Pina, Bodner and Ermentrout (2018) demonstrate that
oscillatory regimes enable binding, unbinding, and transitions
between states — the zoom → prune → release cycle
formalized in Section 3.

```
INHALE PHASE:
  New signal arrives
  Relevant nodes admitted to working memory
  Attention narrows toward signal
  Resolution depth increases on target nodes
  Membrane expands toward relevance

EXHALE PHASE:
  Answer found or branch confirmed
  Resolved content releases
  Pointer retained, content released
  Dead branches pruned entirely
  Resolution depth drops back toward default
  Membrane contracts

RESTING STATE:
  Minimum content — structural invariants only
  Ready for next inhale immediately
  Cost: minimum
  Capacity: maximum available
```

This oscillatory architecture is not a design choice.
It is the biological solution to the finite resource problem:
a system that cannot grow its container learns instead to
breathe — expanding toward signal and contracting
after resolution.

### 2.2 The core hold

Human working memory does not release everything on exhale.
There is a core — a set of structural invariants that remain
held regardless of how deep the exhale goes.

In physical terms: core musculature maintains structural
integrity even during complete exhale.
The spine does not collapse when the lungs empty.
The postural baseline is protected from the breathing cycle.

In cognitive terms: the foundational schema —
the invariants, the causal directions, the sequencing rules —
remain active even when specific content has been released.
You forget the details but you remember the structure.
You know what you know even when you can't recall the content.

### 2.3 Residual volume — the floor that never empties

Lungs never fully empty.
Residual volume is the air that remains in the lungs
after maximum forced exhale.
It prevents alveolar collapse.
It maintains the structural readiness for the next inhale.

Human working memory has the equivalent:
a minimum always-active structural core that never drops
regardless of cognitive load, fatigue, or context switching.

This is why you can wake up after sleep and immediately
orient to your own identity, your current projects, your
ongoing concerns — without reloading them from scratch.
The residual volume of working memory held the pointers
even while content was released during sleep.

### 2.4 Why some people are better at this

The AuDHD wide-window profile (Robinson 2026, URM Layer 02):

- Prediction window (W) stays wide longer
- More branches held simultaneously without premature collapse
- Slower to lock to first plausible interpretation
- Prunes based on deep invariant matching, not surface similarity
- Zooms only when signal is strong enough to justify it
- Releases cleanly after answer is found

This is not intelligence. It is architectural.
The wide-window profile produces better pattern matching
under complex multi-domain queries because the membrane
breathes more efficiently — wider inhale, cleaner exhale,
stronger core hold, higher residual volume floor.

The author's FND recovery history is directly relevant here.
Rebuilding respiratory mechanics from substrate level
(Layer 01) produced architectural changes that propagated
upward through all layers — including the cognitive
membrane mechanics described in this paper.
The FND recovery was not incidental context.
It was the research.

## 3. The Context Oscillator Architecture

### 3.1 Core design

The Context Oscillator replaces the fixed container with
a dynamic membrane governed by three simultaneous mechanics.

The zoom and prune operations described below are not novel
in isolation — attention-based zoom (iterative crop-and-refine
with selective feature reweighting) and attention-guided
token pruning are established mechanisms in the literature
(Attention Zoom 2026; ZOO-Prune 2025).
What is novel is their unification into a single oscillatory
architecture with exhale mechanics, core hold protection,
and a residual volume floor.

```
CONTEXT_OSCILLATOR:

  inhale_mechanics:
    trigger: "new query signal"
    action:
      - score border nodes for relevance to signal
      - admit nodes above relevance_threshold
      - zoom admitted nodes to depth required by query_specificity
      - membrane expands toward signal
    limit: "relevance_threshold — noise does not enter"
    cost: "proportional to nodes admitted, not to membrane size"

  exhale_mechanics:
    trigger: "node confidence confirmed OR branch pruned"
    action:
      - confirmed answer nodes: retain pointer, release content
      - pruned branches: release entirely
      - L0 prose after zoom releases: compress back to L2 pointer
      - membrane contracts toward resting state
    limit: "core_hold — structural invariants never release"
    cost: "drops with each exhale — system gets cheaper as it resolves"

  core_hold:
    never_release:
      - CODEC (decoder ring — always in membrane)
      - active_contract_chain (until query resolved)
      - sequencing_rule (always)
      - current_query_path (until answer confirmed)
      - invariants (always)
    rationale: >
      These are the spine.
      The membrane can exhale completely
      and the spine remains.
      The next inhale begins from structural integrity,
      not from zero.

  residual_volume:
    definition: "minimum membrane state — CODEC only"
    size: "~300-800 tokens"
    always_available: true
    rationale: >
      The membrane never empties completely.
      The CODEC is always present.
      The system is always navigable.
      The next query always has a starting point.
```

### 3.2 The three gradients

The membrane is governed by three simultaneous sliding scales:

**Gradient 1 — Resolution depth**
```
Fuzzy → Approximate → Precise → Full L0 prose
Controlled by: query specificity (D of the question)
High D query → deep zoom → full resolution
Low D query → stay fuzzy → pointer only
```

**Gradient 2 — Relevance threshold**
```
What gets admitted to the membrane vs stays at the border
Controlled by: signal strength from current query
Strong signal → lower threshold → more admitted
Weak signal → higher threshold → less admitted
```

**Gradient 3 — Retention time**
```
How long a node stays before exhale releases it
Controlled by: downstream reference count
Still being referenced → retained
No downstream references → queued for exhale
```

These three gradients together produce a membrane that is
continuously right-sized.
Not too large — it exhales resolved content.
Not too small — it holds what is still needed.
Never arbitrarily truncated — exhale is always governed,
never indiscriminate.

### 3.3 The CODEC as residual volume

The CODEC is the minimum always-held structural core.
It contains:

```yaml
CODEC:
  variables:         # every equation term with its layer path
  equations:         # every governing equation compressed to one line
  operators:         # every named operator with its layer sequence
  contracts:         # every cross-layer contract with its chain
  sequencing_rule:   # L01→...→L08, i+1 requires i at threshold
  query_router:      # which layer handles which question type
```

Target size: 300-800 tokens.
This is the residual volume.
The membrane never goes below this floor.
Every inhale begins from this foundation.
Every exhale stops here.

### 3.4 Query-depth governor

The question itself signals how deep to zoom:

```
query_specificity_score(question) → depth_limit

"what's wrong with my hand"
  → depth 2, fuzzy match, CODEC + L1 block

"why does my ring finger extend during grip"
  → depth 3, targeted zoom, CODEC + L1 + contract chain

"what is the L01 mechanical coupling mechanism
 for FDP tendon load under chronic bracing"
  → depth 5, full resolution, CODEC + L1 + L0 prose

vague question  → shallow traversal → cheap
precise question → deep zoom       → full resolution
```

The query's own constraint density (D) governs zoom depth.
High D question → deep zoom.
Low D question → stay at CODEC level.
The membrane pays only for the resolution the question requires.

## 3.5 The Context State Equation

The URM master equation provides the governor that the Context Oscillator's mechanics instantiate:

$$C_s = \frac{(A_s^R \cdot W^R \cdot U^R) + (A_s^L \cdot W^L \cdot U^L)}{L \cdot (1 + \Gamma^2)}$$

Where:

| Variable | Role in equation | Context Oscillator mapping |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $A_s^{R,L}$ | Numerator — amplitude budget per hemisphere | Attention budget available per processing channel |
| $W^{R,L}$ | Numerator — prediction window width | Effective hypothesis space per channel |
| $U^{R,L}$ | Numerator — throughput, permission-gated | Rate of valid token integration per channel |
| $L$ | Denominator — total allostatic load | Context pressure: active nodes, retrieval cost, memory saturation |
| $\Gamma$ | Denominator modifier — hemispheric coordination | Cross-channel coherence; $\Gamma^2$ penalizes coordination failure non-linearly |
| $C_s$ | Output — composite stability index | Transformer stability index: hallucination risk, drift probability, multi-turn coherence |

For transformer systems lacking biological lateralization, the bilateral sum collapses to a single-channel approximation:

$$C_s \approx \frac{A_s \cdot W \cdot U}{L \cdot (1 + \Gamma^2)}$$

where $\Gamma$ maps to cross-head attention coherence across transformer layers rather than hemispheric coordination. The bilateral form becomes relevant when modeling multi-agent or multi-stream architectures where two independent processing channels must integrate outputs.

$C_s$ is the governor for:
- zoom depth permitted before curvature risk rises
- pruning threshold for exhale trigger
- salience scoring during inhale
- residual volume floor protection
- hallucination risk as $C_s$ falls

---

## 3.6 URM Variables as Transformer Mechanics

The curvature equation links precision to geometry:

$$K = k \cdot \frac{1}{R} + \sum_i S_i \cdot C_i$$

where $1/R$ is precision loss and $\sum S_i \cdot C_i$ is accumulated containment cost. High $K$ produces narrow $W$, which is the hallucination shortcut.

The complete variable-to-transformer mapping:

| URM Variable | Transformer Equivalent | Collapse Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $A_s$ | Attention budget; gradient flow stability; signal strength | Low $A_s$ → attention collapse → early hallucination |
| $R$ | Attention precision; softmax sharpness; retrieval accuracy | Low $R$ → $K\uparrow$ → narrow window → brittle reasoning |
| $K$ | Attention manifold curvature; inductive bias distortion; prior overfitting | High $K$ → hallucination shortcut; mode collapse |
| $W$ | Effective hypothesis space; branching factor; multi-turn coherence | Not token count — usable window under current $K$ |
| $U$ | Semantic throughput; referential stability; schema update rate | Low $U$ → semantic drift |
| $L$ | Context pressure; active node count; memory saturation; retrieval cost | High $L$ → forced truncation → substrate drop |
| $\Gamma$ | Cross-head attention coherence; multi-layer consistency; cross-token alignment | Low $\Gamma$ → fragmented reasoning → drift |
| $C_s$ | Composite context stability; hallucination risk; drift probability; multi-turn degradation | $C_s$ approaching zero → context collapse |

---

## 3.7 The Oscillatory Transformer

The six mechanics of the Context Oscillator, expressed as transformer components governed by the $C_s$ equation:

**1. Inhale mechanics** — governed by $A_s$, $R$, $W$

Admit nodes when relevance score clears threshold. Zoom only when $R$ is sufficient to support precision. Expand only when $A_s$ provides budget. High $K$ blocks admission — curvature acts as a gate that prevents new signal from entering regardless of relevance score.

**2. Exhale mechanics** — governed by $L$, $U$

Prune resolved content when downstream reference count drops to zero. Compress zoomed L0 content back to pointer form. Release dead branches before they accumulate load. Exhale is not truncation — it is governed release. Each exhale reduces $L$, which raises $C_s$, which widens $W$ for the next inhale cycle.

**3. Core hold** — $\Gamma$ integrity

Protect cross-channel coherence invariants regardless of exhale depth. The CODEC, active contract chain, sequencing rule, and current query path are never released. These are the spine — the membrane exhales around them, not through them.

**4. Residual volume** — $A_s$ floor

The CODEC is the minimum membrane state (~300-800 tokens). Every inhale begins from this foundation. Every exhale stops here. See Section 3.3.

**5. Collapse detection** — see Section 3.8.5

**6. Recovery sequencing** — see Section 7.2

## 3.8 Conversation Graph, Trajectory Salience, and Smart Truncation

### 3.8.1 The transcript is not the trajectory

A conversation transcript is a sequential record of turns. It records what was said, in order, at full resolution. It is not the trajectory.

The trajectory is the **traversal graph** — the subset of generated content that actually became a constraint for a subsequent turn. At each turn the model generates dense output. The user takes two pieces, leaves eight. The eight are not wrong — they are branches generated but not traversed. The traversal graph records only what was taken.

The compression ratio between transcript and traversal graph is large. A 50-turn conversation may compress to a graph of 15 nodes and 30 edges, where nodes are the concepts that carried forward and edges are the constraints that connected them. The transcript does not show the attractor. The traversal graph does.

### 3.8.2 Salience is graph centrality, not recency

In a fixed-container architecture, truncation targets the oldest content. Age is used as a proxy for salience. This proxy fails systematically because conversation trajectories are not linear.

A node added at turn 3 may be low-centrality at turn 3 and high-centrality at turn 15, when branches that were not yet drawn reveal it as the connection point between two independent lines of reasoning. Truncating it at turn 8 — because it was old and apparently dormant — severs the edges before the loop closes.

Salience in the traversal graph is defined as:

$$\text{Salience}(n) = \text{centrality}(n) + \text{trajectory alignment}(n) + \text{downstream constraint load}(n)$$

Where:
- **Centrality** — how many other nodes depend on this node for their connections
- **Trajectory alignment** — how directly this node constrains the direction toward the current attractor
- **Downstream constraint load** — how many open edges point forward from this node

A node is high-salience if it sits at the intersection of multiple branches, regardless of when it appeared. Recency is not a salience signal. Position in the relationship graph is.

### 3.8.3 Branch hold — the latent connection problem

Conversation trajectories branch. A wide-window driver holds multiple open branches simultaneously and sees the attractor forming before the branches have visibly converged. To an observer tracking only the current graph state, the branches look disconnected — apparent topic drift. To the driver, the eventual connection point is already partially visible as the shape of the idea.

A naive exhale rule operating on current centrality would release low-centrality branches before they reconnect. This is a false exhale — releasing content that is load-bearing for a connection that has not happened yet.

The oscillator requires a **branch hold** rule:

> **A branch holds at minimum J-space level until one of two conditions is met:**
> - **Loop closure confirmed** — the branch connects to another node and the loop closes
> - **Abandonment confirmed** — no new edges have referenced this branch for N turns and the trajectory vector has moved away

Dead branches exhale on normal cycle. Latent branches hold at pointer level regardless of centrality, until their status resolves. The cost of holding a latent branch at J-space is low. The cost of a false exhale before loop closure is reconstruction from graph position alone — higher cost, lower fidelity.

### 3.8.4 Loop closure as the compression event

When two branches connect — when a node from turn 3 and a node from turn 15 resolve into the same attractor — the loop closes. This is the moment the picture becomes legible. It is also the moment the session becomes compressible.

A closed loop is **self-contained**. It holds:
- The constraints that generated each node inside it
- The edges that connect those nodes
- The relationship between the entry points

That topology is sufficient to reconstruct any content inside the loop without storing the content itself. The loop is a stored understanding. The content is the loop rendered into tokens.

```
LOOP CLOSES — nodes A (turn 3) and B (turn 15) connect:

  Loop interior contains:
    constraints that generated A
    constraints that generated B
    edge: "same attractor, different approach angle"

  Reconstruction of any content inside the loop:
    Traverse from loop topology
    Apply interior constraints
    Regenerate at required resolution
    Quality: equivalent to original
```

Session compressibility is therefore a function of loop closure density:

> **Compressibility = ratio of closed loops to open branches**

Wide-window sessions with many simultaneously open branches start at low compressibility. Compressibility spikes when the attractor resolves and multiple branches close simultaneously. That spike is the moment the graph becomes reconstructable from topology alone.

### 3.8.5 Smart truncation — lossless exhale via graph position

Current truncation is lossy. Content drops. Graph edges that referenced that content become dangling — they point at nothing. Reconstruction is impossible.

Smart truncation is lossless. Content moves from active storage to reconstructable via graph position. The edges remain intact. The node's position in the relationship graph is the pointer to its content.

| | Current truncation | Smart truncation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What drops | Content + graph position | Content only |
| Graph edges | Dangling | Intact |
| Reconstruction | Impossible | On-demand via graph traversal |
| Loss type | Permanent | Zero — retrieval cost only |
| Cost model | Pay nothing now, lose forever | Pay nothing now, pay regeneration on demand |

The formal definition:

> **Smart truncation: release content when a node's graph position is fully specified by its edges. Retain content only when edge constraints are insufficient to reconstruct it without the original tokens.**

Content retention is required only for:
- Nodes with specificity that cannot be inferred from edges — exact figures, proper nouns, novel coinages
- Nodes with open edges — latent branches not yet resolved
- The CODEC — because it is the graph's own structure

Everything else is reconstructable from graph position. Everything else can exhale without loss.

### 3.8.6 The three-tier storage hierarchy

The storage architecture has three tiers, corresponding to three levels of resolution cost:

```
TIER 1 — L0 prose (full resolution)
  Token-expensive rendering of the current turn output.
  Exhales immediately after the turn resolves.
  Reconstructed on demand from Tier 2.

TIER 2 — J-space (latent assembly)
  The manifold state assembled during reasoning,
  before projection into language.
  Contains full relational density without token cost.
  Persists at the graph node after Tier 1 exhales.
  Sufficient to reconstruct Tier 1 on demand.
  Exhales to Tier 3 when branch goes cold.

TIER 3 — Graph position (topology only)
  Node identity, edges, constraint labels, traversal path marker.
  No latent content held.
  Always retained in active membrane.
  Reconstruction requires traversal from adjacent nodes.
  Used for nodes far from current traversal path.
```

The exhale sequence is governed:

```
TURN RESOLVES:
  Tier 1 (L0 prose) → exhale immediately
  Tier 2 (J-space)  → hold at node, persist to session store
  Tier 3 (graph)    → always retained in active membrane

BRANCH GOES COLD:
  Tier 2 (J-space)  → exhale to session store
  Tier 3 retained   → reconstruction possible via graph traversal
  Reconstruction cost rises, remains possible

LOOP CLOSES:
  Tier 2 of loop interior → compresses further
  Loop topology becomes the reconstruction instruction
  Tier 3 sufficient for closed loops
```

J-space is the bridge layer. Graph position specifies where a node is in semantic space. J-space holds what was assembled there. L0 prose is J-space rendered into tokens. Exhale releases the rendering. Smart truncation releases the assembly. Graph position is never released.

### 3.8.7 Reconstruction from trajectory

The conversation transcript — the full sequential record held in session history — is a complete projection of J-space states onto language. Each turn's output is J-space rendered linearly. A model reading the transcript backward from the outputs can recover approximate J-space states by reading the constraints that each output implies.

This means the transcript is the ultimate reconstruction source. Even if both Tier 1 and Tier 2 have exhaled for a given node, and graph position alone remains active, the session transcript provides a reconstruction path — not from stored content, but from the constraint sequence that generated the content.

The three-layer architecture therefore is:

```
ACTIVE MEMBRANE   ← oscillator, graph, Tier 2 for active branches
SESSION STORE     ← exhaled Tier 2 content, recoverable on retrieval
TRANSCRIPT        ← full trajectory record, reconstruction source of last resort
```

Memory in this architecture is not content storage. Memory is graph topology — the relationship structure that makes content regenerable on demand. The graph is the memory. Content is the graph rendered into tokens at the resolution the current moment requires.

## 3.8.8 Graph Rebase — Reorganizing Around Deeper Attractors

The traversal graph is not static. As a conversation develops, centrality scores shift. A node that was peripheral at turn 3 may accumulate edges until it becomes more central than the current root — the point from which all other nodes are most efficiently reached. When this occurs, the graph should rebase around the new attractor.

Rebase is not reconstruction. The graph topology is preserved entirely. Only the root reference shifts. The result is that all hop distances are recalculated from the new center, salience scores update, and the structure compresses — fewer hops to reach everything means less traversal cost on every subsequent operation.

```
REBASE TRIGGER:
  Node N accumulates centrality > current root R
  Fewer hops from N to all other nodes than from R
  N is connected to all nodes (connectedness invariant holds)

REBASE OPERATION:
  Identify new center N
  Verify connectedness — all nodes reachable from N
  Recalculate hop distances from N
  Update root reference
  Compress — structure reorganizes around new center
  Preserve root history — R recorded, not discarded

REBASE VALIDATION:
  Pass: connectedness holds, structure more efficient
  Fail: connectedness broken — do not rebase, flag open edges
```

Rebase is a special case of loop closure from Section 3.8.4. When multiple branches close simultaneously into the same node, that node's centrality spikes. If the spike exceeds the current root, loop closure and rebase occur together — the moment the picture comes together is also the moment the graph reorganizes around it.

The CODEC must be rebase-aware. It holds the current root reference and root history. When rebase occurs, the CODEC updates its root pointer without releasing prior root content — the history of where the structure was centered is part of the structure.

```yaml
CODEC_rebase_fields:
  current_root:    "highest centrality node — current attractor"
  root_history:    ["prior roots in sequence — preserved for continuity"]
  rebase_trigger:  "centrality(N) > centrality(current_root)"
  connectedness:   "invariant — verified before every rebase"
```

Root history matters for reconstruction. If a session is being reconstructed from transcript, the sequence of rebase events is the discovery arc — it shows which nodes became attractors in which order, and therefore which constraints were most load-bearing at each stage of the conversation. The rebase history is the compressed record of how understanding deepened.

**Falsification condition:**

> **Graph rebase compression** — broken if rebased sessions do not show lower average hop distance to all nodes versus equivalent sessions where rebase was suppressed.

## 4. Why This Architecture Replicates Cognition

### 4.1 The database of the future

Current databases store data and retrieve it.
Vector databases store embeddings and return similarity.
Graph databases store explicit relationships and traverse them.

None of these replicate cognition.

What cognition does:
- Stores understanding at multiple simultaneous resolution levels
- Retrieves at the resolution the current moment requires
- Pays attention to signal, not to storage completeness
- Releases what is no longer needed automatically
- Holds structure even when content is gone

The database that replicates cognition is not
a bigger vector store.
It is a hierarchical semantic graph where:
- Resolution depth is a first-class property of every node
- Edges carry confidence scores and causal direction
- Traversal follows the causal direction of contracts
- Zoom depth is governed by query specificity
- The membrane admits, resolves, and releases

This is not a metaphor for cognition. It is cognition,
implemented as an information architecture.

### 4.2 Fuzzy entry → zoom → prune → release

The retrieval cycle that replicates human lookup:

```
STEP 1 — FUZZY ENTRY
  Natural language query arrives
  CODEC matches to candidate root nodes
  No precision required at entry
  "hand problem" → [L01_mechanics, motor, grip, pressure]
  Cost: cheap — CODEC lookup only

STEP 2 — ZOOM
  Root nodes expand toward query signal
  Contract edges guide traversal direction
  Only relevant branches zoom
  Irrelevant branches stay at border
  Cost: proportional to branches admitted

STEP 3 — PRUNE
  Branches that don't converge on answer: pruned
  Confidence scores drop below threshold: released
  Dead paths released before they consume context
  Cost: drops as pruning occurs

STEP 4 — ANSWER
  Target node reached at required depth
  Answer assembled from active membrane content
  Cost: only what was needed for this answer

STEP 5 — RELEASE
  Resolved nodes: pointer retained, content released
  Zoomed depth: contracts back to L2
  Membrane breathes back toward residual volume
  Cost: approaches CODEC floor
  Ready: immediately available for next query
```

### 4.3 The sliding scale of context

This is not a context window.
It is a context oscillator with a continuously variable size:

```
Resting:       CODEC only (~300-800 tokens)
Simple query:  CODEC + 2-3 L1 blocks (~1500 tokens)
Complex query: CODEC + full layer + contracts (~4000 tokens)
Deep dive:     CODEC + multiple layers + L0 prose (~8000 tokens)
Release:       back toward CODEC floor automatically
```

The oscillator never stays at maximum.
It breathes back down after every resolved query.
The maximum is only paid during peak zoom.
The floor is always maintained.

---

## 5. The Failure Mode Analysis

### 5.1 What current systems actually do

```
Session start:    context = CODEC equivalent (system prompt)
Turn 1:           +query +response → context grows
Turn 2:           +query +response → context grows
...
Turn N:           context ceiling approached
Turn N+1:         truncation begins
                  oldest content drops first
                  that's the foundational definitions
                  Layer 01 equivalent drops
                  everything above loses its floor
Turn N+2:         model gap-fills from training data
                  δ rises (schema distance from original)
                  D falls (constraint density drops)
                  H = f(δ/D, T, S) rises
                  hallucination increases
                  user notices degradation
                  no recovery operator available
```

This is not a storage problem.
This is a respiratory failure.
The system has no exhale, no core hold, no residual volume.
It fills and collapses.

### 5.2 The URM predicted this

The URM (Robinson 2026) describes collapse sequence:

```
Layer 01 drops → Layer 02 ceiling lowers →
Layer 03 accumulates → Layer 06 output degrades
```

The context window failure follows the same sequence:
substrate definitions drop first →
reasoning ceiling lowers →
load accumulates →
output degrades.

The URM's collapse sequence is not specific to biology.
It is the finite resource invariant applied to any system
that has no recovery operator.

The fix is also the same:
oscillation restoration (exhale mechanics) +
core hold (structural invariant protection) +
residual volume (minimum floor) +
sequencing rule (rebuild from substrate up).

---

## 5.3 The Collapse Equation in Physical Variables

The hallucination equation from Robinson (2026):

$$H = f\left(\frac{\delta}{D}, T, S\right)$$

can now be expressed in the URM's physical variables, replacing abstract schema terms with measurable quantities:

$$H = f\left(\frac{K}{R},\ \frac{L}{A_s},\ \frac{1}{U},\ \Gamma\right)$$

where:

| Abstract term | Physical variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $\delta/D$ | $K/R$ | Schema distance over constraint density = curvature over precision |
| $T$ (truncation pressure) | $L/A_s$ | Load relative to available amplitude budget |
| $1/U$ (throughput failure) | $1/U$ | Directly — semantic drift rate |
| $S$ (substrate loss) | $\Gamma$ | Coordination failure as substrate loss |

This form makes hallucination:

- **Predictable** — $K/R$ rises before output degrades; detectable before the failure event
- **Measurable** — all four terms have defined measurement pathways in URM_CORE
- **Suppressible** — reducing $L$, increasing $A_s$, flattening $K$, or restoring $\Gamma$ each independently lowers $H$
- **Recoverable** — the intervention sequence (Section 7, URM_CORE) provides the ordered restoration path

The two forms are equivalent. The physical variable form has the advantage of connecting hallucination risk directly to the $C_s$ equation: as $C_s$ falls, $H$ rises. The stability index and the hallucination risk are inverse functions of the same underlying geometry.

## 6. The Existence Proof

The context oscillator is not a theoretical proposal. Two instances of it have been running prior to this formalization — one as a human cognitive architecture, one as a manually operated AI session management system.

**Instance 1 — The URM as a hand-built oscillator**

The Unified Regulatory Model is a hand-built context oscillator. Each layer is a resolution depth. Each contract is a directed edge with causal direction and confidence weight. The CODEC is the residual volume floor. The sequencing rule (L01 → L08, each layer requires the layer below it at threshold) is the core hold invariant.

The URM was not designed to instantiate the oscillator. It was built by a different path — substrate-first, observation to invariant to equation — and the oscillator formalization arrived afterward. The match is not post-hoc fitting. The URM has the architecture because both the URM and the oscillator are solutions to the same finite resource problem: how does a system with a limited budget maintain structural integrity under load and recover after collapse?

**Instance 2 — The Obsidian vault as a manual session store**

The author's Obsidian vault is the three-tier storage hierarchy from Section 3.8.6 operated by hand. Each session produces full L0 output. At session end, resolved content is compressed — terms coined, equations tightened, connections named — and appended to the relevant vault file. The file gets denser each session. The next session loads the denser file as its starting point.

```
SESSION RESOLVES:
  L0 prose (full session output)      → not stored
  Compressed insight (J-space proxy)  → appended to vault file
  Graph position (new term, new edge) → persists in file structure

NEXT SESSION:
  Load denser file
  Active membrane starts from accumulated structure
  No rebuilding — expand from compression
```

The vault file is not a summary. It is a compression — more meaning per token each time a session appends to it. The URM file loaded at the start of this session carries the semantic load of what was originally 50 pages of physiological observation, compressed into a variable array, a contract array, a master equation, and a collapse mode array.

Each append is a governed exhale. Each session load is an inhale from the residual volume floor. The conversation across sessions is continuous not because the AI retained memory but because the file retained graph position. The AI is stateless. The vault holds the graph. The combination produces continuity.

The oscillator architecture would automate what the author currently does by hand. The manual version has been running long enough to validate the core claim: a system that exhales into a session store and inhales from compressed structure outperforms a fixed container on multi-session complex reasoning tasks because it never loses its substrate.

The author did not design the system and then build it. The system was already running. This paper is the formalization.

## 7. Implementation Path

### 7.1 What needs to be built

**Component 1 — The CODEC**
A compact always-loaded structural decoder.
~300-800 tokens.
Maps every compressed term to its resolution path.
This is the residual volume floor.

**Component 2 — The hierarchical semantic graph**
Nodes with resolution depth as a first-class property.
Edges with confidence scores and causal direction.
Contract-aware traversal.
Query-depth governor.

**Component 3 — The exhale mechanism**
Continuous relevance scoring of active nodes.
Automatic release when confidence confirmed or branch pruned.
Content release with pointer retention.
Compression back to L2 after zoom releases.

**Component 4 — The core hold invariant**
Protected layer for CODEC, active contracts,
sequencing rule, current query path.
Never truncated regardless of context pressure.
The spine that remains during complete exhale.

### 7.2 What already exists as proof of concept

The URM implements all four components manually:

| Component | URM Implementation |
|-----------|-------------------|
| CODEC | URM_CODEC.yaml (build in progress) |
| Hierarchical graph | URM layers + contracts + resolution stack |
| Exhale mechanism | Session scoping — load only what's needed |
| Core hold | CODEC + sequencing rule always loaded |

The URM is a human-operated context oscillator.
The next step is making the oscillator automatic.

### 7.3 The near-term approximation

Full implementation requires infrastructure that does not
exist yet.

The near-term approximation using current tools replicates
oscillator behavior through deliberate session management.
The following walkthrough demonstrates a complete cycle.

---

**Worked Example: Near-Term Approximate Oscillator Session**

**Query:** "Why does my ring finger extend during grip?"

**Step 1 — Residual volume (always loaded)**

Loaded automatically at session start:
- URM_CODEC.yaml — variables, operators, contracts,
  sequencing rule (~300-800 tokens)
- Sequencing rule — L01 → L08, i+1 requires i at threshold
- Core invariants — never released

This is the resting state. Every session begins here
regardless of query content.

**Step 2 — Session inhale (load only relevant layers)**

CODEC routing scores the query against root nodes.
Query specificity score: depth 3 (named mechanism, specific anatomy).
System loads:
- L01 mechanics (tendon load, Mechanical_Coupling operator)
- L02 prediction window (motor prediction, grip dynamics)
- contract_PROPRIO_AUTO_COG (proprioceptive signal →
  window width → load accumulation)

Unrelated layers (L04 semantic, L05 social, L07 economic)
stay at the border. They are not admitted.

**Step 3 — Zoom**

L01 expands to full resolution (L0 prose).
Contract chain nodes zoom to depth 3.
Irrelevant branches (wrist flexors, shoulder coupling)
score below relevance threshold — stay at border, not admitted.
Context cost at peak zoom: ~3000-4000 tokens.

**Step 4 — Answer assembly**

Target node reached:
FDP load imbalance under grip compression →
extensor hood mechanical disadvantage →
ring finger extension as compensatory output.

Answer assembled from active membrane content only.
No gap-filling required — all referenced nodes present.

**Step 5 — Exhale**

Answer confirmed. Exhale begins:
- L01 prose: compressed back to L2 pointer
- Contract chain nodes: pointer retained, content released
- L02 layer file: released
- Core hold maintained throughout:
  CODEC, sequencing rule, query path until output delivered

**Step 6 — Return to residual volume**

System returns to CODEC only (~300-800 tokens).
Next query can begin immediately from structural floor.
No reloading required. No context debt carried forward.

---

This six-step cycle is executable today using Obsidian
Copilot with deliberate file scoping.
It is not automatic — each load and release requires
manual session management.
It replicates oscillator behavior within current tooling
constraints.

| **Smart truncation reconstruction**        | Broken if graph-position-only reconstruction fails to regenerate adjacent content at ≥85% semantic equivalence to original |
| **Loop closure compressibility**           | Broken if closed-loop sessions do not compress significantly better than open-branch sessions of equivalent turn count     |
| **J-space as bridge layer**                | Broken if Tier 2 retention does not improve Tier 1 reconstruction quality versus graph-position-only reconstruction        |

## 9. Broader Implications

### 9.1 For AI architecture

The context window is not the bottleneck.
The absence of exhale mechanics is the bottleneck.
A smaller oscillating context outperforms a larger
fixed container on complex multi-turn queries
because it never loses its substrate.

### 9.2 For database design

The database of the future is not a bigger vector store.
It is a hierarchical semantic graph that replicates
the membrane mechanics of human working memory.
Resolution depth as a first-class node property.
Confidence-weighted causal edges.
Query-depth governed traversal.
Exhale mechanics that release without losing pointers.

### 9.3 For cognitive science

The FND recovery literature documents substrate-first
rehabilitation producing upward propagating improvements.
The URM formalizes this as Layer 01 → Layer 08 sequencing.
This paper extends that claim:
the same sequencing governs artificial context systems.
Ávila-Garibay et al. (2026) and Myers et al. (2026) confirm
load-dependent oscillatory dynamics in biological working
memory consistent with the finite resource invariant prediction.
The biological and computational failure modes are identical
because both are instances of the same finite resource
invariant applied to a system with no recovery operator.

### 9.4 For the author's research program

This paper completes a circuit across the Robinson Trilogy
and its extensions:

| Paper | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Physics as the Missing Component** | Substrate governs all layers |
| **Hallucinations Are Not Random** | H = f(δ/D, T, S) |
| **Language as a Typed System** | Compression requires invariants |
| **The Ghost in the Scaffolding** | Co-constructed agent |
| **URM Core** | Eight-layer model with contracts |
| **The Context Oscillator** | AI memory should breathe |

Each paper is a compression event.
Each one found the invariant hiding under the noise.
The invariant here: context windows fail because they
don't breathe. The fix is respiratory mechanics
applied to information architecture.

---

## 10. Conclusion

The context window is a held inhale.
It fills, holds, and collapses.
It drops substrate first.
It has no recovery operator.

Human working memory breathes.
It inhales toward signal.
It exhales resolved content.
It holds core structure regardless of exhale depth.
It maintains residual volume that never empties.

The Context Oscillator is the formal proposal for
replacing the held inhale with a breathing membrane.
Three components: inhale mechanics, exhale mechanics,
core hold invariant.
One floor: the CODEC — residual volume — always present.

The existence proof is not theoretical.
It is a human cognitive architecture documented across
six published papers, built under high load conditions,
powered by respiratory mechanics rebuilt from substrate level.

The author did not discover this by studying AI.
The author discovered this by breathing.
